# CORMAP
Simple C++ classes for Object Relational Mapping

### Dependencies:
`sudo apt-get install libmysqlcppconn-dev`

### Developer guidelines
Cormap has been developed using the following code guidelines:

1. All private member variables get an underscore in front of them.
 * Someone using this class can't access those variables directly anyway, so I would rather they were ugly than the method parameters.
 * An exception to this is private member functions
2. Avoid the use of `this->` and `this`.
3. Method signatures are made as pretty as possible, meaning full-length words and consistency throughout.
4. All files end on a new line.
5. A blank line is kept open between methods
6. Curly braces are as follows:
    if (condition) {
             ...
    }
7. Spaces are included before opening parentheses or curly braces, e.g. between `if` and `(`, `)` and `{`, etc
 * An exception to this is the declaration and use functions and classes.
