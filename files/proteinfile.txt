Simple text file to test FileField class.
FYI, plan for using the class was as follows...

A) Allow users to save files:
When a user enters a file entry in the database.
    1) They give the full path to the file
    2) Cormap must make a copy of the file and save it to a specific path
    3) Cormap must keep track of both the path and the name of the file

b) Provide functionality to access the file (more tricksy)
I guess we can reverse the process in (A)
